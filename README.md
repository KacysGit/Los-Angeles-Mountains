Purpose: Skill assessment practicing converting a PSD file to an HTML5 file.

I created this project using Illustrator, GIMP, Visual Studio Code, youtube, Photoshop, and w3schools.

## Ambiguous Design Notes
### Carousel
I was unsure how the carousel was supposed to display the minimized images. In the supplied PSD file, it had repeats of images in the carousel. I could not wrap my head around what functionality would make this desirable. I would normally implement an Agile method to check early and often with the client to confirm that the product I am supplying is as desired; however, as this is an interview assessment I did not see this as a good option and made a best attempt with the information I had.
