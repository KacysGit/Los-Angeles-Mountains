Purpose: Skill assessment practicing converting a PSD file to an HTML5 file.

I created this project using Illustrator, GIMP, Visual Studio Code, youtube, and w3schools.

## Ambiguous Design Notes
### Carousel
I was unsure how the carousel was supposed to display the minimized images. In the supplied PSD file, it had repeats of images in the carousel. I could not wrap my head around what functionality would make this desirable. I would normally implement an Agile method to check early and often with the client to confirm that the product I am supplying is as desired; however, as this is an interview assessment I did not see this as a good option. 
### Images
This is the first time I have worked with Illustrator and I was having trouble extracting the images from it. I had to find some online to complete the project.
### Second Tab
Do to the trouble with Illustrator, I was unable to see what the second tab (Mountain 2) is supposed to look like. I programmed it to the best of my ability without being able to see it.
